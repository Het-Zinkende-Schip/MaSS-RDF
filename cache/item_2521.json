In 1917 the vessel was taken over by the <em>Schlesische Dampfer-Compagnie</em> (SDC) based in Hamburg, in 1971 it was bought by the <em>Westf&auml;lische Transport-Actien-Gesellschaft</em> (WTAG) in Dortmund, and in 1973 the vessel once again changed ownership, when it was bought by G&uuml;nther Kroll, who renamed the vessel <em>Uwe</em>.</p> <p>On 19th December 1975, under influence of thick fog, <em>Uwe</em> was overtaken by the freighter <em>Wiedau</em>, when the Polish freighter <em>Mieczyslaw Kalinowski</em> appeared from the fog, which lead to a collision with <em>Wiedau</em>'s bow. Due to the impact, <em>Wiedau</em> turned to starboard and collided with <em>Uwe</em>, cutting the hull into two halves. Most of the crew saved their lifes by jumping overboard and swimming to the beach, while two lost their lifes. Here is an artist's impression of the broken off stern section (top) and the original vessel before the accident (below).</p> <figure class=\"img-wrapper\"><img src=\"/photos/l/00002591.jpg\" alt=\"The image shows a sketch of a shipwreck lying on the shore with a smaller vessel nearby\"> <div class=\"img-source\">Oleksiy Konovalov</div> </figure></div>\n<h1 id=\"h-description\">Beschrijving</h1>\n<div lang=\"en\"><table class=\"metavalues\"><tbody><tr><th scope=\"row\">Lengte</th><td>197 &frac34; voet (60,3 m)</td></tr><tr><th scope=\"row\">Grootste wijdte</th><td>21 voet (6,4 m)</td></tr></tbody></table></div>\n<h1 id=\"h-status\">Status</h1>\n<div lang=\"en\"><p>Today, the wrecks of <em>Uwe</em> and <em>Polstjernan</em> are popular spots for sightseeing and scenic photographs.
