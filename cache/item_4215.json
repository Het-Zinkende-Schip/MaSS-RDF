It had started plying the Greek seas at the beginning of the century, not very far from where it came to grief. But having survived both World Wars and even the process of scrapping, 91 years of seafaring were finally to come to an end. Interestingly, the ship and the nearby lighthouse which signals the entrance to the Thermaikos Gulf were built around the same time.</em></p> <p>More details at <a href=\"https://www.wreckhistory.com/kathleen/?lang=en\">https://www.wreckhistory.com/kathleen/?lang=en</a>.</p></div>\n<h1 id=\"h-description\">Beschrijving</h1>\n<div lang=\"en\"><table class=\"metavalues\"><tbody><tr><th scope=\"row\">Lengte</th><td>154 voet (47 m)</td></tr><tr><th scope=\"row\">Breedte</th><td>21 &frac14; voet (6,5 m)</td></tr><tr><th scope=\"row\">Tonnage</th><td>231 ton</td></tr></tbody></table></div>\n<h1 id=\"h-status\">Status</h1>\n<div lang=\"en\"><p>The shipwreck was designated as a monument in 2024, according to the Law 4858/2021 (<a href=\"https://diavgeia.gov.gr/doc/65%CE%A4%CE%9946%CE%9D%CE%9A%CE%9F%CE%A4-5%CE%A8%CE%A0?inline=true\">https://diavgeia.gov.gr/doc/65%CE%A4%CE%9946%CE%9D%CE%9A%CE%9F%CE%A4-5%CE%A8%CE%A0?inline=true</a>).</p></div>\n",
