The machine and generator were scrapped by a salvage company. Soon thereafter, the wreck remains were covered by sediments again. In the summer of 1994, the frames re-appeared. Due to the scouring effect, it took only six months until the wrecksite was almost entirely exposed again.</p> <figure class=\"img-wrapper\"><img src=\"/photos/l/00002447.jpg\" alt=\"shipwreck in the sand by the sea, with people next to it\"> <div class=\"img-source\">K&uuml;hn, H.-J.
