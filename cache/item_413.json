She left Gibraltar on 9th March for Portugal Lisboa. 15th march she left Lisboa for Leix&otilde;es. This time SS Dago was alone. At 17:00 a plane was spotted. The gunners fired at the plane. They missed and that turned out to be very lucky. The plane turned out to be an allied Short Sunderland Flying Boat.</p> <p>At 18:30 a plane came from the east. However this time it was a German Focke-Wulf 200 Condor. The German plane attacked immediately. shot and dropped 3 bombs. The SS Dago was hit and sunk. The crew got away in the lifeboats. Only four men were injured.</p> <h2>Research and identification</h2> <p>Near Penich are identified two wrecks both steamers. The most likely candidate for the SS Dago is wreck 1.</p> <p>Wreck 1 - investigated by amateur divers - had a triple expansion engine (three cylinders), wreck 2 had only&nbsp;two cylinders.<br>(Source : <a href=\"http://www.academia.edu/2085829/SS_Dago_-_From_Wreck_to_Ship\">From wreck to ship</a> )</p></div>\n<h1 id=\"h-description\">Beschrijving</h1>\n<div lang=\"en\"><div>British steam cargo ship.<br>Built 1902 by Caledon Shipbuilding &amp; Co., Dundee Scotland. <br>Owned by Ellerman Wilson Line.&nbsp;</div> <div>Length: 296 ft.<br>Beam: 37.2<br>Draft: 17:<br>Tonnage: 1757</div> <div>Propulsion: a steam vertical reciprocating compound triple expansion engine<br>Speed: 11.5 knts<br>Complement: 32 (6 naval gunners)<br>Armament: anti aircraft defense</div> <div>Sunk by a Focke-wulf 200 condor <figure class=\"img-wrapper\"><img src=\"/photos/l/00000974.jpg\" alt=\"Picture: Armando Ribeira.\" width=\"268\" height=\"399\"> <figcaption class=\"img-description\">Picture: Armando Ribeira.</figcaption> </figure> </div><table class=\"metavalues\"><tbody></tbody></table></div>\n<h1 id=\"h-status\">Status</h1>\n<div lang=\"en\"><p>Wreck 1 is lying on a depth of ca. 50 m. 500 m from a second wreck.
