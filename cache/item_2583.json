The wreck lies bottom up and has been addressed as one of the transport ships that could not escape her pursuers when it capsized.</p></div>\n<h1 id=\"h-description\">Beschrijving</h1>\n<div lang=\"en\"><p>The wreck is situated in the tidal mudflats of the Pirolatal on the beach of the island of Langeoog. The hull shape indicates a flat-bottomed vessel with a rounded stern. A few floor-timbers with integrated limber-holes, top-timbers in parallel alignment to the latter, and massive stem- and sternposts were observed. The dendrochronological analysis of a sample taken from a floor-timber yielded a felling date of around/after 1798.</p> <figure class=\"img-wrapper\"><img src=\"/photos/l/00002642.png?modifiedon=1622544237\" alt=\"Photo of the remains of a sunken barge, with people around it.\"> <div class=\"img-source\">Jana Fries</div> </figure><table class=\"metavalues\"><tbody><tr><th scope=\"row\">Lengte</th><td>61 &frac34; voet (18,8 m)</td></tr><tr><th scope=\"row\">Breedte</th><td>12 &frac12; voet (3,8 m)</td></tr></tbody></table></div>\n<h1 id=\"h-status\">Status</h1>\n<div lang=\"en\"><p>The wrecksite has been known for some time, but it was not until October 2012 when it was officially reported.</p> <p>The responsible regional branch in Oldenburg of the Lower Saxony State Office for Monument Preservation (NLD: <em>Nieders&auml;chsisches Landesamt f&uuml;r Denkmalpflege</em>) carried out a survey in July 2013 before the wrecksite became subject to a beach nourishment measure, carried out by the State Agency for Water Management, and Coastal and Environmental Protection of Lower Saxony (NLWKN: <em>Landesbetrieb f&uuml;r Wasserwirtschaft, K&uuml;sten- und Naturschutz</em>). Local guides were instructed to notify the NLD in case the wreck becomes unearthed again.</p> <p>In February 2016, a tidal creek has formed in close proximity to the wreck, becoming subject to further erosion and destruction. Most of the wreckage was reported missing in April.</p> <p>The wrecksite was a local sightseeing attraction and the condition of the wreck was frequently reported in the local news.</p></div>\n<h1 id=\"h-references\">Referenties</h1>\n<div lang=\"en\"><ul><li>Fries, J.
