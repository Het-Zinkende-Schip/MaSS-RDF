Nonetheless, a windlass for the anchor cable, an angular transom stern, and a well-preserved rudder were observed. The fact that there is no indication for a propeller, and thus no engine, calls the hypothesis into question that this could be a vessel of the mid 20th century. Amongst wreck-divers it has simply become known as <em>Zweimaster</em> (two-masted vessel).</p> <figure class=\"img-wrapper\"><img src=\"/photos/l/00002657.jpg\" alt=\"a shipwreck on the bottom of the sea, covered with algae\"> <div class=\"img-source\">Erhard Schulz</div> </figure> <figure class=\"img-wrapper\"><img src=\"/photos/l/00002658.jpg\" alt=\"photo of a wooden ship on the bottom of the sea, completely covered with algae\"> <div class=\"img-source\">Erhard Schulz</div> </figure> <figure class=\"img-wrapper\"><img src=\"/photos/l/00002659.jpg\" alt=\"photo of a wooden ship on the bottom of the sea, completely covered with algae\"> <div class=\"img-source\">Erhard Schulz</div> </figure><table class=\"metavalues\"><tbody><tr><th scope=\"row\">Aantal opvarenden</th><td>7</td></tr><tr><th scope=\"row\">Lengte</th><td>78 &frac34; voet (24 m)</td></tr></tbody></table></div>\n<h1 id=\"h-status\">Status</h1>\n<div lang=\"en\"><p>Following the hint of the historian who traced the fate of the abovementioned stone-fishing vessel, the Maritime and Hydrographic Agency of Germany (BSH: <em>Bundesamt f&uuml;r Seeschifffahrt und Hydrographie</em>) intensively searched this area and discovered the wreck in 2006.</p></div>\n<h1 id=\"h-references\">Referenties</h1>\n<div lang=\"en\"><ul><li>Oppelt, I.
