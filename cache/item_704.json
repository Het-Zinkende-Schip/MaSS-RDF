The next morning the Spaniards tried to enter Havana with full sail. However, the bay was blocked by Ita. The galleons had to sail past Havana and were driven by the Dutch to the coast where they ran aground just east of Havana.</p> <p>The Dutch tried to get closer with the intention to enter. During this attempt a Dutch ship De Leeuwin also landed. The crew of the Leeuwin was therefore heavily bombarded by the Spaniards. The rest of the Dutch ships were warned and kept at a distance. The fight lasted all day. Eventually the Dutch overpowered both the galleons. The Spanish crew gave up the fight, jumped overboard and tried to reach the coast swimming.</p> <p>The Noordster is mentioned in sources after this incident. It is unclear what became of her.</p></div>\n<h1 id=\"h-description\">Beschrijving</h1>\n<div lang=\"en\"><p>Tonnage: 30 last<br>Crew: 40<br>Armament: 4 bronze, 4 iron cannon<br>Master:&nbsp;Corn.
