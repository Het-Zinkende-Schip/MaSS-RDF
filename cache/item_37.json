Her wartime success ended on 3 November, 1917, when she was torpedoed and sunk by the submarine <em>HMS C15</em>. <em>UC-65</em> was homeward-bound via a rapid surface run when she was sighted by <em>C15</em>. <em>C15</em> dove, firing two torpedoes, the first of which <em>UC-65</em> avoided, but the second struck her amidships. Twenty two crew members went down with the sub, and there were five survivors, including the commander of the sub.</p><p>A wreck site of a WWI era U-boat was found twenty nautical miles south-southwest of Hastings, and the initial investigation of the site concluded that the wreck was of <em>UC-65</em>.</p></div>\n<h1 id=\"h-description\">Beschrijving</h1>\n<div lang=\"en\"><ul> <li>Type: UC II class submarine</li> <li>Launched: 8 July, 1916</li> <li>Navy: Kaiserliche Marine</li> <li>Length: 57 m</li> <li>Beam: 6.4 m</li> <li>Draft: 4 m</li> </ul> <figure class=\"img-wrapper\"><img src=\"/photos/l/00000085.jpg\" alt=\"A UC II type mine-laying submarine\" width=\"499\" height=\"289\" /><figcaption class=\"img-description\">A UC II type mine-laying submarine</figcaption></figure><table class=\"metavalues\"><tbody></tbody></table></div>\n<h1 id=\"h-status\">Status</h1>\n<div lang=\"en\"><p>The wreck is broken in two at a depth of approximately 41 m in the middle of the central vessel separation zone of the eastern English Channel.
