She ran aground on a January night in 1825 in an area called Mamparia Gutu. For days, countless items washed up ashore. Governor Debrot noted a chest of cheese, 92 barrels of gunpowder, 50 barrels of butter, three large mirrors, flour, tobacco, meat, lumber, and even a piano.</p> <figure class=\"img-wrapper\"><img src=\"/photos/l/00001918.jpg\" alt=\"A coastline between the sea and a beach\"> <figcaption class=\"img-description\">The coastline at Mamparia Gutu where the William &amp; Ezra ran aground.</figcaption> </figure> <p>The sea floor in this area slopes very gently for several hundred meters. At the wreck site, between 1.5 and 3 meters, lie archaeological remains that most likely belong to the William &amp; Ezra. Spread out over some 50 meters, these include four anchors, five cannons, and a broken cannon. At the easternmost cannons, divers have reported to have found fragments of copper, glass, and ceramic artifacts.</p> <figure class=\"img-wrapper\"><img src=\"/photos/l/00001919.jpg\" alt=\"Newspaper article\"> <figcaption class=\"img-description\">Newspaper article about the wrecking in the Cura&ccedil;aosche Courant from January 22, 1825.</figcaption> </figure> <figure class=\"img-wrapper\"><img src=\"/photos/l/00001917.jpg\" alt=\"A sketch map, showing cannon and anchor distribution.\"> <figcaption class=\"img-description\">A sketch map of the wreck site, showing cannon and anchor distribution.</figcaption> </figure></div>\n<h1 id=\"h-description\">Beschrijving</h1>\n<div lang=\"en\"><table class=\"metavalues\"><tbody></tbody></table></div>\n",
