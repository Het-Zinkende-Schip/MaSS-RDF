The Lion wreck is well preserved. The Lion wreck is lying keel on the sea-bed as if she is still sailing. Even the shape of the vessel is still very much intact. On the top of the ships rudder is a carved wooden lion, giving the wreck its working name. The original name of the ship is unknown. The ship seems to be a sister to The Ghost Wreck, found in 2007 in the middle of the Baltic Sea. The bow and bowsprit of the Lion wreck was damaged suggesting a collision as cause of sinking. The three masts are still standing in situ. Rigging details are still visible.</p> <figure class=\"img-wrapper\"><img src=\"/photos/l/00000620.jpg\" alt=\"Lion wreck\" /><figcaption class=\"img-description\">Drawing of the wreck by Niklas Eriksson.</figcaption></figure> <p><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/hX4OnYldBfw\" width=\"440\" height=\"248\" frameborder=\"0\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe></p></div>\n<h1 id=\"h-description\">Beschrijving</h1>\n<div lang=\"en\"><div>Fluyt, length: 21.8 m, stem- to sternpost.
