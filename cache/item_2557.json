It can be doubted that the vessel carried a sail, so it seems more likely that it carried a towing-mast.</p> <figure class=\"img-wrapper\"><img src=\"/photos/l/00002578.png\" alt=\"photo of an excavated barge, with a group of people next to it\"> <div class=\"img-source\">M&uuml;cke 2011</div> </figure> <p>The wrecks feature so-called L-shaped chine girders, but with a greater angle in cross-section, as there is no sharp transition at the turn of the bilge.</p> <p>Teerhof 3 (<em>Lastkahn 1</em>) dates to 1681 and Teerhof 4 (<em>Lastkahn 2</em>) to 1668. Both wrecks seem to have ended here at the same time in the beginning of the 18th century. They are situated in a former canal once seperating the <em>Teerhof</em> (Bremen's historic shipyard) and a gunpowder tower known as 'Braut' (literally: bride), which was filled at this time. Thus, the wrecks might have been purposely abandoned here to serve as foundation.</p><table class=\"metavalues\"><tbody></tbody></table></div>\n<h1 id=\"h-status\">Status</h1>\n<div lang=\"en\"><p>The wrecks were salvaged and PEG-conserved at the DSM (German Maritime Museum) and studied within the framework of a Master's thesis.</p></div>\n<h1 id=\"h-references\">Referenties</h1>\n<div lang=\"en\"><ul><li>Bischop, D.
