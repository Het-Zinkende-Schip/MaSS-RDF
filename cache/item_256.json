It was under the command of Kapit&auml;n leutnant (a rank similar to U.S. and British ranks of Lieutenant or Lieutenant Commander) Hans Hufnagel. <em>U-106</em> was officially commissioned for the Imperial German Navy 28 July, 1917, and began her first, and only, wartime patrol on September 2, 1917.</p> <p>A little over two weeks later, on September 18 and during the First Battle of the Atlantic, <em>U-106</em> was credited with the sinking of the <em>HMS Contest</em>, an Acasta-class destroyer, as well as with damaging a 5,867 ton steamer, <em>City of Lincoln</em>, in the Western Approaches. The Western Approaches, a term mostly used in naval warfare, refers to a geographical area of the Atlantic Ocean just west of the British Isles.</p> <p>After her military success in the First Battle of the Atlantic, <em>U-106</em> was in the North Sea, off the coast of the Dutch island Terschelling, where she fell out of radio contact on October 7th. She shortly there after struck a British mine, and sank with the entire crew of 41 men.</p> <figure class=\"img-wrapper\"><img src=\"/photos/l/00000459.jpg\" alt=\"photo of the side of a destroyer at sea\"> <figcaption class=\"img-description\">HMS Contest, sunk by U-106.

First thought to be a Dutch submarine lost in 1940, it was soon realized to be a sub of much older origin.</p> <p>After official identification by German authorities, and the notification of the families of the lost crew, it was announced in 2011 that the remains of <em>U-106</em> had been discovered, and that the site would be declared a war grave.</p></div>\n<h1 id=\"h-description\">Beschrijving</h1>\n<div lang=\"en\"><ul> <li><strong>Class:</strong> U-93 excellent seagoing abilities.
