It was built by Daniel Harriott from Bermuda, who founded the Harriott salt production and export business in 1829. The two-storey building, constructed of Bermuda limestone, features a typical Bermuda kitchen on the seaside and a limestone Bermuda roof. Its ground floor and basement was originally used to store salt, while the first floor served as living quarters. The roof got badly damaged during hurricane Irma in 2017, but restorations are underway.</p> <figure class=\"img-wrapper\"><img src=\"/photos/l/00002893.jpg\" alt=\"Aerial view of the White House and associated marine structures.\"> <figcaption class=\"img-description\">Aerial view of the White House and associated marine structures.

Bermudians had been raking salt on the island for many years already, and this tradition continued into the nineteenth century.</p> <figure class=\"img-wrapper\"><img src=\"/photos/l/00002892.jpg\" alt=\"The White House on Salt Cay\"> <figcaption class=\"img-description\">Aerial view of the White House with the salt pans in the background.

Associated marine structures include a dock and repair facilities for the vessels engaged in the salt trade.</p> <figure class=\"img-wrapper\"><img src=\"/photos/l/00002894.jpg\" alt=\"The White House and associated marine structures at the turn of the twentieth century.
