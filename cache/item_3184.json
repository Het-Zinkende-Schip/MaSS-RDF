Luckily, all aboard were saved despite the rough ocean conditions, but the ship was destroyed.</p> <p>There is some uncertainty about the identity of the master of the ship, who might have been Jan Kampuhis, as well as the tonnage of the vessel, which is believed to have been 198 tons.</p> <p>The photograph in this entry shows the area in which the<strong>&nbsp;</strong><em>Johanna</em>&nbsp;wrecked, albeit roughly 60 years prior.</p></div>\n<h1 id=\"h-description\">Beschrijving</h1>\n<div lang=\"en\"><table class=\"metavalues\"><tbody><tr><th scope=\"row\">Kapitein</th><td>A Kamphuis</td></tr><tr><th scope=\"row\">Aantal opvarenden</th><td>7</td></tr><tr><th scope=\"row\">Tonnage</th><td>198 ton (99 last)</td></tr></tbody></table></div>\n<h1 id=\"h-references\">Referenties</h1>\n<div lang=\"en\"><ul><li>Dean Mcleland.<br /><a href=\"http://thecasualobserver.co.za/tag/baakens-river/\">Tag Archives: Baakens River.</a></li><li>Lesa la Grange, Martijn Manders, Briege Williams, John Gribble and Leon Derksen (2024).<br /><em>Dutch Shipwrecks in South African Waters: A Brief History of Sites, Stores and Archives [Unpublished].</em></li><li><em>SAHRA Database.</em></li></ul></div>\n",
