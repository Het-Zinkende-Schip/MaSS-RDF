Text contributed by Jay Haviser, Director of Sint Maarten Archaeological Center (SIMARC):</p> <p>This is an 18th century Dutch War Frigate shipwreck site, situated atop a sandbar directly out from Great Bay harbor. The original Dutch ship was named &ldquo;Jason&rdquo; in 1770, but was taken by the British and renamed &ldquo;Proselyte&rdquo; in 1796. The Proselyte sank on the reef outside Great Bay on September 2, 1801.</p> <figure class=\"img-wrapper\"><img src=\"/photos/l/00003553.jpg\" alt=\"Proselyte anchor and site\"> <div class=\"img-source\">T.
