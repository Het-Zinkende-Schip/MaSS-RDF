The pilot perished during this crash.</p> <p>He was a part of the 32nd Squadron, based at Aruba. However, the main base was stationed at Hato in Cura&ccedil;ao, and the airplanes divided their time between Aruba and Cura&ccedil;ao. The 32nd Squadron was based at Aruba for a short period of time after the submarine attacks on the oil tankers and the refinery. The squadron left for Panama in 1944 and remained there until the end of the war. However, a portion of the pilots were transferred to different squadrons in Europe. During its time in Aruba and Panama, the 32nd squadron functioned as a training unit for new pilots before they were transferred overseas.
