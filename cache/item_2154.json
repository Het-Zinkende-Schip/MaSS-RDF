The end of the pier, however, was still fairly close to shore in shallow water, so vessels using the pier were often affected by swells too. To tackle this problem, a 23-meter-long extension of the structure was planned, but this project never came to fruition (Grol 1921:161).</p> <figure class=\"img-wrapper\"><img src=\"/photos/l/00002130.jpg\" alt=\"Many people are at a house picking up luggage.\"> <figcaption class=\"img-description\">People picking up newly arrived goods at the customs office (the old weighing house) in 1928.

The area around the old weighing house remained the focus of the island&rsquo;s import and export until well into the twentieth century. This was the place where people came to pick up imported goods. The pier has remained a unique Statian landmark until the present day.</p> <figure class=\"img-wrapper\"><img src=\"/photos/l/00002126.jpg\" alt=\"A sunken pier\"> <figcaption class=\"img-description\">The pier in 1955.
