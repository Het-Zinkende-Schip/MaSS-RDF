  "body": "<h1 id=\"h-description\">Beschrijving</h1>\n<div lang=\"en\"><p>In 2003 two softwood beams were found in a national park in Zeeland. Both beams were full of nail-holes and imprints of large nail heads. This could be prove of a technique that was used to protect East Indiaman ships from shipworm (<em>Teredo navalis</em>). The technique&nbsp;involved applying an outer layer of (usually small) planks that were covered&nbsp;with wide-headed nails. These nails would eventually corrode and form a protective layer against shipworm. The beams are thus suspected to have been used as a protective layer for a ship, pier or quay. The beams are unofficially dated between the 17th and 19th century.</p></div>\n<h1 id=\"h-references\">Referenties</h1>\n<div lang=\"en\"><ul><li>Akker van den, J., M. Manders, W. van der Wens, A.
