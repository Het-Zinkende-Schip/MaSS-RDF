Due to poor visibility V187 managed to sail past the four destroyers unscathed, but encountered another group of destroyers, which engaged V187 at close range, disabling the machine and causing a blaze. The British lowered rescue boats to pick up V187's crew, but the Germans mistook them for boarding commandoes and opened fire on one of the British destroyers. In a final blow, the British re-opened fire too and sank V187 at about 10:10. 24 of V187's crew were killed, 14 wounded and 33 taken prisoner.</p> <p>In 2018, the wrecksite was investigated by SUBMARIS and the Jacobs University of Bremen, which produced multibeam and side-scan sonar imagery of the wreck.</p></div>\n<h1 id=\"h-description\">Beschrijving</h1>\n<div lang=\"en\"><table class=\"metavalues\"><tbody><tr><th scope=\"row\">Aantal opvarenden</th><td>84</td></tr><tr><th scope=\"row\">Snelheid</th><td>32 knopen ~ 59 km/u (37 mijl per uur)</td></tr><tr><th scope=\"row\">Lengte</th><td>242 &frac12; voet (73,9 m)</td></tr><tr><th scope=\"row\">Grootste wijdte</th><td>26 voet (7,9 m)</td></tr><tr><th scope=\"row\">Deplacement</th><td>650 ton</td></tr></tbody></table></div>\n<h1 id=\"h-status\">Status</h1>\n<div lang=\"en\"><p>V187 is the only wreck of the Battle of Heligoland, which sank in German territorial waters, and thus is not only protected as war grave, but also as historic monument by the State Archaeology Department of Schleswig-Holstein.</p></div>\n<h1 id=\"h-references\">Referenties</h1>\n<div lang=\"en\"><ul><li>Gröner, E., Jung, D., Maass, M.
