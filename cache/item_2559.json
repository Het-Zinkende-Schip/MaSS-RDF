It was reported to Dr. Siegfried Fliedner and Dr. Rosemarie Pohl-Weber of the Focke Museum (Bremen's municipal history and art museum) who investigated the wreck.</p> <figure class=\"img-wrapper\"><img src=\"/photos/l/00002580.png\" alt=\"photo of the excavation of a tree trunk\"> <div class=\"img-source\">Pohl-Weber 1969</div> </figure> <p>It was decided to salvage the wreck, which was manually moved onto the embankment, after the sand masses were removed by a dredger. This was a rescue operation, as the site was subject to dredging within the framework of a port development scheme. The wreck was made shortly after the spectacular discovery and salvage of the \"Bremen Cog\" a year before and thus never received the same level of attention, although all involved specialists were already sensitised to wreck-discoveries in the context of dredging operations.</p> <p>In 1972 a further wreck fragment was discovered not far from this site, which is associated with the same wreck.</p> <p>The excavators identified the river craft as a type known locally as <em>\"eke\"</em>, which was mentioned frequently in Bremen's toll register of the 14th century. <em>Ekes</em> were distinguished to logboats (<em>enbomene schepe</em>), although (if the identification is indeed correct) an <em>eke</em> would classify as logboat-like vessel.</p></div>\n<h1 id=\"h-description\">Beschrijving</h1>\n<div lang=\"en\"><p>The hull was assembled by two halved hollowed out tree-trunks (ca. 5 cm in thickness), which formed the sides, as well as a bottom-plank. The vessel was reinforced with frames. The boat was joined together with treenails, while no residues of iron fasteners were observed.</p> <p>The C14 analysis indicate a date between 1070 and 1240, while a dendrochronogical analysis yielded a date of around 1200.</p><table class=\"metavalues\"><tbody><tr><th scope=\"row\">Lengte</th><td>29 &frac12; voet (9 m)</td></tr><tr><th scope=\"row\">Breedte</th><td>5 voet (1,5 m)</td></tr></tbody></table></div>\n<h1 id=\"h-references\">Referenties</h1>\n<div lang=\"en\"><ul><li>Bishop, D.
