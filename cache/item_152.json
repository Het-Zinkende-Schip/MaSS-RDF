It turned out to be a vessel with a combination of rowing and sailing options.</p> <p>The Woerden 7 was a Roman barge or flatboat. These kind of ships are well known in the Netherlands. Similar ships were found in Zwammerdam during the 70's and De Meern in 1996.</p> <p>It is a simple type of ship, a flat horizontal bottom with vertically brims. The mast was located at a third from the ship's front. These ships were used to transport goods or people.</p> <figure class=\"img-wrapper\"><img src=\"/photos/l/00000276.jpg\" alt=\"The image shows the remains of the Roman cargo ship 'Woerden 7' and a reconstruction of it.\"> <figcaption class=\"img-description\">The Woerden 7.</figcaption> </figure> <figure class=\"img-wrapper\"><img src=\"/photos/l/00000287.jpg\" alt=\"an aerial photo of a shipwreck that has been uncovered\"> <figcaption class=\"img-description\">Aerial photograph.</figcaption> </figure> <h2>Rowing facility</h2> <p>Unique evidence concerning the way of propulsion on the Woerden 7. Notches in a horizontal board may be used to secure seats on which the crew sat while rowing. On a vertically board holes were found. These holes showed wear-damage which is probably caused by oars.</p> <figure class=\"img-wrapper\"><img src=\"/photos/l/00000277.jpg\" alt=\"The image probably shows the remains of the Woerden 7, a Roman flat-bottomed barge.\"> <figcaption class=\"img-description\">The notches where seats were fitted.</figcaption> </figure> <figure class=\"img-wrapper\"><img src=\"/photos/l/00000278.jpg\" alt=\"the oarholes of a shipwreck\"> <figcaption class=\"img-description\">The oarholes.</figcaption> </figure> <h2>Shoes</h2> <p>At the bottom of the rowing-facility, leather shoes were found.

These are most likely the remains of a hearth. Traces of soot also point in this direction.</p> <figure class=\"img-wrapper\"><img src=\"/photos/l/00000280.jpg\" alt=\"Tuff and brick from the hearth.\"> <figcaption class=\"img-description\">Tuff and brick from the hearth.</figcaption> </figure> <h2>Discovery</h2> <p>June 2003, during the construction of a profile at the Nieuwe Markt in Woerden, the remains of a shipwreck were found by an archaeological company. The wrecks date was estimated at 158 AD.</p> <p>A three-day pilot-study was planned to learn more about the wrecks exact location, length, the conservation state and its surroundings. This pilot study was realized in August 2003.</p> <p>The excavation took place from September until November 2003, the development and reporting from June 2005 until January 2007.</p> <figure class=\"img-wrapper\"><img src=\"/photos/l/00000282.jpg\" alt=\"The image shows the remains of a shipwreck.\"> <figcaption class=\"img-description\">Profile of the Woerden 7.</figcaption> </figure> <figure class=\"img-wrapper\"><img src=\"/photos/l/00000289.jpg\" alt=\"people looking at an excavated shipwreck\"> <figcaption class=\"img-description\">Over 10.000 people visited the excavation's view-day.</figcaption> </figure> <p>Archaeological finds</p> <figure class=\"img-wrapper\"><img src=\"/photos/l/00000285.jpg\" alt=\"two Fishing-hooks\"> <figcaption class=\"img-description\">Fishing-hooks were found underneath the wreck.</figcaption> </figure> <figure class=\"img-wrapper\"><img src=\"/photos/l/00000286.gif\" alt=\"The image probably shows a reconstruction or diagram of a Roman ship, possibly specifically the ship known as \"> <figcaption class=\"img-description\">The blue parts indicate the repairs which were made with Dutch wood.</figcaption> </figure></div>\n<h1 id=\"h-description\">Beschrijving</h1>\n<div lang=\"en\"><p>Roman Flatboat type: Zwammerdam.</p> <p>length : 29.60 m (100 roman inch)</p> <p>width : 4.70 m</p> <p>drougth: 1.25 m</p> <p>ratio : 1:6.3</p> <p>Building technique: Roman with local features. The flatboat was used as a river cargo ship.</p> <p>Flatboats are usually rectangle boats with a shallow draft. Its propulsion was provided by a mast with a square sail and the stream of the river on which it sailed. The Woerden 7 was also equipped with a rowing facility.</p> <figure class=\"img-wrapper\"><img src=\"/photos/l/00000275.gif\" alt=\"drawing of a Roman flatboat.\"> <figcaption class=\"img-description\">A Roman flatboat.</figcaption> </figure> <figure class=\"img-wrapper\"><img src=\"/photos/l/00000290.jpg\" alt=\"Stern part with crossbeams.\"> <figcaption class=\"img-description\">Stern part with crossbeams.</figcaption> </figure> <h2>Location</h2> <p>The ship is located at the inner curve of a former Rhine meander, Southwest of the castellum Laurium.</p> <figure class=\"img-wrapper\"><img src=\"/photos/l/00000281.gif\" alt=\"The image shows a map of Roman sites in the Low Countries, with emphasis on the Lower Germanic Limes, the northern border of the Roman Empire.\"> <figcaption class=\"img-description\">The Limes.
