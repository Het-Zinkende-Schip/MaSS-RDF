  "body": "<h1 id=\"h-history\">Historie</h1>\n<div lang=\"en\"><p>This wreck is associated with the British steam trawler MOUNTBATTEN, which was built by Cochrane &amp; Sons Shipbuilders Ltd. and was operated by Trawlers Ltd. when it stranded in Rodoy Fjord, Norway. The ship was refloated by a Norwegian salvage company and sold to Germany, where it was brought under tow. On its way to Hamburg in March 1951, the vessel developed a list in the Elbe estuary in heavy weather and foundered. It was salvaged again and brought to a scrapping yard in the industrial port district of Hamburg-Moorburg nearby the coal plant.</p> <figure class=\"img-wrapper\"><img src=\"/photos/l/00002550.jpg?modifiedon=1619432063\" alt=\"photo of a harbor, with a sunken fishing vessel in Germany\"> <div class=\"img-source\">Wikimedia Commons</div> </figure></div>\n<h1 id=\"h-description\">Beschrijving</h1>\n<div lang=\"en\"><table class=\"metavalues\"><tbody><tr><th scope=\"row\">Snelheid</th><td>12 knopen ~ 22 km/u (14 mijl per uur)</td></tr><tr><th scope=\"row\">Lengte</th><td>161 voet (49,1 m)</td></tr><tr><th scope=\"row\">Breedte</th><td>16 &frac34; voet (5,1 m)</td></tr><tr><th scope=\"row\">Tonnage</th><td>441 ton</td></tr></tbody></table></div>\n<h1 id=\"h-status\">Status</h1>\n<div lang=\"en\"><p>The vessel was never scrapped and has become a biotope.
