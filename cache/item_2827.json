Only two of Whydah Gally's crew survived, along with seven others who were on a sloop captured by Bellamy earlier that day. Six of the nine survivors were hanged, two who had been forced into piracy were freed, and one Indian crewman was sold into slavery.</p></div>\n<h1 id=\"h-description\">Beschrijving</h1>\n<div lang=\"en\"><table class=\"metavalues\"><tbody><tr><th scope=\"row\">Kapitein</th><td>Samuel &quot;Black Sam&quot; Bellamy</td></tr><tr><th scope=\"row\">Aantal opvarenden</th><td>150</td></tr><tr><th scope=\"row\">Snelheid</th><td>13 knopen ~ 24 km/u (15 mijl per uur)</td></tr><tr><th scope=\"row\">Lengte</th><td>111 &frac12; voet (34 m)</td></tr><tr><th scope=\"row\">Tonnage</th><td>300 ton (150 last)</td></tr></tbody></table></div>\n<h1 id=\"h-references\">Referenties</h1>\n<div lang=\"en\"><ul><li>Cape Cod National Seashore.<br /><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/articles/whydah.htm\">The Wreck of the Whydah.</a></li></ul></div>\n",
