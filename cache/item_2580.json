Behind the hatchways are the fuel tanks. The broad transom stern is a very notable feature.</p> <p>The uncommonly narrow length-to-beam ratio and the wooden construction point to an E-boat (<em>Schnellboot</em>) or minelayer. The remains of the collapsed deckhouse are situated near the stern section, which would have been unusual for an E-boat.</p> <figure class=\"img-wrapper\"><img src=\"/photos/l/00002615.jpg\" alt=\"The image shows a drawing of a shipwreck.\"> <div class=\"img-source\">Oleksiy Konovalov</div> </figure> <p>The stempost of the vessel is well visible.</p> <figure class=\"img-wrapper\"><img src=\"/photos/l/00002645.jpg\" alt=\"photo of a shipwreck with a diver next to it\"> <div class=\"img-source\">Erhard Schulz</div> </figure> <p>Among the scattered remains of the wreck are also several single finds, like a K98 rifle, one of the most common rifles of the <em>Wehrmacht</em>.</p><table class=\"metavalues\"><tbody><tr><th scope=\"row\">Lengte</th><td>65 &frac12; voet (20 m)</td></tr><tr><th scope=\"row\">Breedte</th><td>13 voet (4 m)</td></tr></tbody></table></div>\n<h1 id=\"h-status\">Status</h1>\n<div lang=\"en\"><p>This wreck was discovered at a depth of 19 metres during a survey routinely carried out in 1981 by the Federal Maritime and Hydrographic Agency of Germany (BSH: <em>Bundesamt f&uuml;r Seeschifffahrt und Hydrographie</em>).</p> <p>The wreck is overgrown by anemones and is reasonably well preserved.
