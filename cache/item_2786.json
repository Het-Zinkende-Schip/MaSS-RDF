It was the wreck of the Hamburg-based mooring boat HIEV IN (High German for \"haul in\").</p> <figure class=\"img-wrapper\"><img src=\"/photos/l/00003030.jpg\" alt=\"side view of a dented and destroyed wreck of a boat\"> <div class=\"img-source\">Wasser-und Schifffahrtsamt Elbe-Nordsee</div> </figure> <figure class=\"img-wrapper\"><img src=\"/photos/l/00003029.jpg?modifiedon=1641290051\" alt=\"front view of a dented and destroyed wreck of a boat\"> <div class=\"img-source\">Wasser-und Schifffahrtsamt Elbe-Nordsee</div> </figure> <p><br>How and where exactly HIEV IN sank is not documented. It is presumed that the vessel filled up with water in heavy weather and sank. All crew members were rescued. The vessel was on its way to Stade-B&uuml;tzfleth. The time of sinking has not been recorded, but it must have been sometime between the date of commissioning (1958) and the launch of a follow-up vessel under the name of HIEV IN (1964).</p></div>\n<h1 id=\"h-description\">Beschrijving</h1>\n<div lang=\"en\"><p>Mooring boats aided the docking manoeuvre of large ships by taking over massive hawsers on the ship's side to take them to the quayside, where they are fastened to bollards. The skipper can coordinate the manoeuvre by his own effort and windlasses. The occupation of 'moorer' is considered one of the most dangerous professions in the port still today. The handling of heavy hawsers and the vortices caused by ship's propeller bear considerable risks.</p> <figure class=\"img-wrapper\"><img src=\"/photos/l/00003031.jpg?modifiedon=1641290406\" alt=\"Illustration of a small boat sailing past large ships and cranes\"> <div class=\"img-source\">Hafenmuseum Hamburg</div> </figure> <p>HIEV IN was built in 1958 by Hamburg's long-standing shipyard Albert Bonn&eacute; (later renamed: <em>Zehbe‑Werft</em>) in Wilhelmsburg at Vogelh&uuml;ttendeich. After the currency reform, the shipyard gained a good reputation with the mooring company Max Meyn and others. Due to the hull shape and sturdy construction, the vessel was operated during winters with ice drift, and thus rendered an indispensable service in the harbour. The first engine of HIEV IN had 38 hp, which was later replaced by a 70 hp Hanomag-engine of a type also regularly used in farm and crawler tractors. Fragments of the engine are still preserved.</p><table class=\"metavalues\"><tbody><tr><th scope=\"row\">Vermogen</th><td>70 pk</td></tr><tr><th scope=\"row\">Lengte</th><td>25 &frac12; voet (7,8 m)</td></tr><tr><th scope=\"row\">Grootste wijdte</th><td>8 &frac14; voet (2,5 m)</td></tr><tr><th scope=\"row\">Deplacement</th><td>8 ton</td></tr></tbody></table></div>\n<h1 id=\"h-status\">Status</h1>\n<div lang=\"en\"><p>The wreck is in the property of the Water and Shipping Authority responsible for the Elbe river (<em>Wasser-und Schifffahrtsamt Elbe-Nordsee</em>) and is currently exhibited on the open-air premises of the Port Museum.</p></div>\n<h1 id=\"h-references\">Referenties</h1>\n<div lang=\"en\"><ul><li>German Port Museum in Hamburg (official website).<br /><a href=\"https://www.shmh.de/deutsches-hafenmuseum/\">Hafenmuseum Hamburg.</a></li><li>Wasserstraßen- und Schifffahrtsamt Hamburg.<br /><a href=\"https://www.fahrrinnenanpassung.de/baustellen-nachrichten/bauma%C3%9Fnahmen-kopie.html\">Schiffswrack entdeckt und geborgen.</a></li></ul></div>\n",
