In this project 72.000 m2it was systematically prospected at the Playa de la Isla Mazarr&oacute;n (Murcia), and more than 7.000 fragments of Phoenician objects were recovered. The remains of the ship were only covered for a thin stratum of sand. The wreck was revealed due to the change of currents taken place by construction close to the wreck.</p> <figure class=\"img-wrapper\"><img src=\"/photos/l/00000333.jpg\" alt=\"The image shows an underwater archaeological excavation, possibly of a shipwreck\"> <figcaption class=\"img-description\">Hull with frames.</figcaption> </figure> <p>During&nbsp;the excavation&nbsp;campaign of 1996, numerous fragments of Phoenician pottery were documented. They were located immediately under the wood of the ship,&nbsp;seperated by only a layer of 4 or 5 cm of sand.</p> <p>The features of naval construction suggest a date in the first half of the first millennium bce. Groningen University (The Netherlands) framed five samples of wood and algae within in the 7th and 6th centuries bce.</p> <p>The sum and the crosslink of all these data, with a special reference to the Phoenician pottery, contribute to give us a global date of 650 - 600 bce</p></div>\n<h1 id=\"h-description\">Beschrijving</h1>\n<div lang=\"en\"><p>Phoenician Merchant ship.
