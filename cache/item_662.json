This is typical for a logboat with&nbsp;clinkerbuilt extended board.</p> <p>It seems that multiple plank fragments were part of a logboat. Another fragment had an alder wood pen with a striking trapezoidal head. This pen type is know from Slavic shipbuilding tradition.</p> <p>Dendrochronological research has revealed that at least part of the wood was from the German Rhineland dated approximately 653 AD.</p></div>\n<h1 id=\"h-description\">Beschrijving</h1>\n<div lang=\"en\"><table class=\"metavalues\"><tbody></tbody></table></div>\n<h1 id=\"h-references\">Referenties</h1>\n<div lang=\"en\"><ul><li><em>W.
