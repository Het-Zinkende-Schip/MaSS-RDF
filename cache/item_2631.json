It was situated 370 metres off the coast of the island of Saaremaa at a depth of 3 metres, in a natural harbour at the foot of the Maasilinn castle ruin.</p> <figure class=\"img-wrapper\"><img src=\"/photos/l/00002797.png\" alt=\"a diver at the bottom of the sea\"> <div class=\"img-source\">Eesti Meremuuseum</div> </figure> <figure class=\"img-wrapper\"><img src=\"/photos/l/00002798.png\" alt=\"The wreck in situ in shallow waters.\"> <div class=\"img-source\">Eesti Meremuuseum</div> <figcaption class=\"img-description\">The wreck in situ in shallow waters.</figcaption> </figure> <figure class=\"img-wrapper\"><img src=\"/photos/l/00002799.png\" alt=\"The wreck fragment was lifted in one piece by divers.\"> <div class=\"img-source\">Eesti Meremuuseum</div> <figcaption class=\"img-description\">The wreck fragment was lifted in one piece by divers.</figcaption> </figure> <p>The wreck was excavated and lifted in 1987 by <em>Viikar</em> divers, a group of recreational divers interested in archaeology under the lead of Vello M&auml;ss, who became the head of the newly formed division of underwater archaeology at the Estonian Maritime Museum in the following year. The wreck was conserved in a purpose-built facility with PEG (polyethylene glycol) and smaller object were freeze-dried. Owing to the novelty of a fully fledged archaeological wreck excavation and the lack of experience, the wreck was only partially recorded and sampled.</p> <p>Samples from the clinker planks were dendrochronologically analysed and yielded felling dates in the 1543-1546 range. Almost the entire hull was built of local pine.</p> <p>The vessel was associated with a small single-masted coastal vessel known as <em>uisk</em>.</p> <p>The wreck's location and residues of slaked lime in its bilge suggest that it was linked to the castle of Maasilinn (German: <em>Soneburg</em>) and its lime quarry, which was owned by the Order of Teutonic Knights at that time. This period was marked by intensified castle building across the territories of the Livonian Confederation and the vessel was arguably involved in the shipping of lime required as building material.</p> <figure class=\"img-wrapper\"><img src=\"/photos/l/00002805.jpg\" alt=\"View from a gun-emplacement of the castle ruin of Soneburg on the V&auml;ike-V&auml;in Sound.\"> <div class=\"img-source\">Mikael Fredholm</div> <figcaption class=\"img-description\">View from a gun-emplacement of the castle ruin of Soneburg on the V&auml;ike-V&auml;in Sound.</figcaption> </figure></div>\n<h1 id=\"h-description\">Beschrijving</h1>\n<div lang=\"en\"><p>The Maasilinn Ship is the hitherto earliest known type of wreck, in which a secondary layer of carvel planks were fastened on top of an originally clinker-built hull (a so-called &ldquo;converted clinker&rdquo;).

Another notable feature is the deep bilge-well, achieved by garboard strakes running almost vertically.</p> <figure class=\"img-wrapper\"><img src=\"/photos/l/00002794.png\" alt=\"Schematic reconstruction of building sequence: (A) I.
