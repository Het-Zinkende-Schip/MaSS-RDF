The site was surveyed and partially excavated by Dr. Hans-Joachim K&uuml;hn (State Archaeology Department of Schleswig-Holstein) in 1997. The stem- and sternpost were unearthed, respectively, revealing draught marks up to 8 feet (bow) and 10 feet (stern). Thus, the remaining hull is preserved up to ca. 3 metres under the sediment cover. A further test-trench dug in the midship section revealed ceiling planks, a keelson and an indication for a proper keel instead of a flat-bottom.</p> <figure class=\"img-wrapper\"><img src=\"/photos/l/00002456.jpg\" alt=\"the outline of a shipwreck became visible by the frames projecting out from the sediment cover.\"> <div class=\"img-source\">K&uuml;hn, H.-J.
