In ten&nbsp;days 1100 (wine) amphora&rsquo;s were retrieved from the wreck with a mechanical bucket. Only 110 stayed intact. There were no site plan or drawings made.</p> <p>However primitive, this was one of the first maritime archeology investigations. It urged the new discipline of maritime archeology to develop more scientific methods (see also Grand Conglou&eacute; wreck).</p> <p>Between 1961-1971 archaeologist Nino Lamboglia supervises the recovery of the&nbsp;<br>remaining cargo. The site was dated to ca. 100 BC by Campanian black glazed ware indicates port of call in the Naples region.</p></div>\n<h1 id=\"h-description\">Beschrijving</h1>\n<div><table class=\"metavalues\"><tbody></tbody></table></div>\n<h1 id=\"h-status\">Status</h1>\n<div><p><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/f2DI7z4Xjgc\" width=\"440\" height=\"248\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe></p></div>\n<h1 id=\"h-references\">Referenties</h1>\n<div><ul><li><a href=\"http://oxrep.classics.ox.ac.uk/databases/sites/italy/albenga/\">Databases | The Oxford Roman Economy Project.</a></li><li><em>B.M.
