A heavy storm forced the drop anchor off Cascais, a small village a few miles from Lisbon. Captain Manuel Barreto Rolim desided to seek shelter in the Tagus estuary. On manouvering to do so the ship sunk in front of the S&atilde;o Juli&atilde;o da Barra fortress in&nbsp;a matter of hours.</p> <h2>Cargo</h2> <p>Her main cargo was pepper. A large amount of pepper was saved and put to dry. The population also salvaged a notable quantity, as it was impossible for the soldiers to stop the locals who, despite the dreadful weather conditions, every night went to the sea in small craft to salvage what they could. During the subsequent summers, the officers of king Felipe III of Spain - who was also king Felipe II of Portugal - may have salvaged a great part of the cargo from the shallow waters, and they certainly rescued cables, anchors and guns.<br>(source: DANS, and Texas A&amp;M University)</p> <figure class=\"img-wrapper\"><img src=\"/photos/l/00000398.jpg\" alt=\"painting with eight ships next to each other on the quay\"></figure></div>\n<h1 id=\"h-description\">Beschrijving</h1>\n<div lang=\"en\"><p>Portuguese East Indiamen.
